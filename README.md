### Hi, I'm Cameron Roe

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer @smartbear working on the mobiles platform for @crossbrowsertesting. I also tinker with various toy projects in my free time and love learning new programming languages. I also do a bit of blogging about various things I learn and want to share. Lately, I have been enjoying hacking on GitHub Actions and using it to do awesome things with other GitHub features.

You can read my blog at https://cameronbroe.com

You can email me at cameron@cameronbroe.com

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions with any of my public projects or if you want to talk about my blog. I'm also looking to get more involved with the open source community as whole and would love to collaborate on something awesome.
